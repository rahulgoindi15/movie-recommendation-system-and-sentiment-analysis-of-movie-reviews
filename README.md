# Movie Recommendation System and Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews
This is ML project on movie recommendation system based on genre and ratings and sentiment analysis of user reviews of movies, i.e they liked it or not.


For Movie Recommendation System, our team used two Recommendation Engines:Content Based Filtering and Model-Based Collaborative Filtering.
Both the recommendation engines are used for their own advantages.We try to reduce the value of RMSE to get better results.


For Review Classification I used 3 types of naive bayes namely Gaussian Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes. 
Bernoulli and Multinomial Classifiers were equally good and Gaussian did not perform  that well as it works best on continuous data. 
The accuracy can be improved upto 0.88 if we train the model on full training set.
